# Appointment-Post-Enhancement
Post Enhancement Version of Appointment application for CS 499

Updated version of the Appointment program. Test cases have been updated to cover more edge cases to prevent crashes as well as the addition of a new ServiceDriver class. This ServiceDriver class allows for command line interface with the user in order to bring the application closer to the actual functionality of an Appointment tracker software. An executable Jar file has also been created to allow for distribution of the application. 

The application can be run by navigating to the directory the jar file is held in a command line window and typing the command 
''' java -jar ServiceDriver.jar '''
This will launch the application from the command line and allow for interfacing.

The application should run on any version of Java 1.8 and up
